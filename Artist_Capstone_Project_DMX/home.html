<article><h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Earl Simmons (born December 18, 1970) better known by his stage name <em>DMX</em> (also known as <em>Dog Man X</em> and <em>Dark Man X</em>) is a <strong>multi-Platinum American rapper and actor</strong>. His stage name was originally an acronym
of "Divine Master of the Unknown", but also pays tribute to an instrument he used in the 1980s, the Oberheim DMX drum machine. In 1999, DMX released his best-selling album ...And Then There Was X, which
featured the hit single "Party Up (Up in Here)". He has acted in films such as Belly, Romeo Must Die, Exit Wounds, Cradle 2 The Grave, and Last Hour. In 2006, he starred in the reality television series
DMX: Soul of a Man, which was primarily aired on the BET cable television network. In 2003, DMX published a book of his memoirs entitled, E.A.R.L.: The Autobiography of DMX.</p>

<p>DMX was born on December 18, 1970, to Joe Barker and Arnett Simmons (who became pregnant with him when she was nineteen years of age). There are conflicting reports as to where he was born, with some
saying he was born in Baltimore, MD and other saying he was born in Mount Vernon, NY. He was the second child born; his mother had a two year old daughter from a previous relationship. He was raised as a
Jehovah's Witnesses. At a young age his Mother moved them to the infamous School Street projects in Yonkers where DMX would learn his trade of robbing. As a youth, he committed crimes such as robbery and
spent much of his adolescence in and out of juvenile detention and youth group homes. DMX always looked down on street level drug dealers and found it easier to simply rob the dealers of their earnings
at the end of the day. While always close to his uncles and a few close friends he found his true companionship in the many stray dogs that he befriended. Throughout this period, DMX viewed hip-hop as
an escape from his troubles; he enjoyed beatboxing, turntablism, and eventually, rapping.</p>

<p>In February 1998, DMX released his debut major-label single, "Get at Me Dog", on Def Jam Recordings. The single was certified Gold by the RIAA. His first major-label album, It's Dark and Hell Is Hot,
which included the single "Ruff Ryders Anthem", was released in May 1998. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart in the U.S and sold over five million copies. Later that year in
December, DMX released his second album, Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, where it remained for three consecutive weeks. Within one week of the album's
release, 670,000 units were shipped.[citation needed] It was eventually certified Platinum four times. As a result, DMX was the second rapper in history (following Tupac Shakur) to have released two
albums in the same year, which both debuted at number one on Billboard 200.</p>

<p>DMX released his third and best-selling album (as of January 2012), ...And Then There Was X, on December 21, 1999. It was his third album to debut at number one on the Billboard 200. Its most popular
single, "Party Up", became his first Top Ten hit on the R&B charts. Singles "What's My Name?" and "What These Bitches Want" were also popular. The album was certified Platinum six times. After improving
his legal situation, DMX returned to the studio to complete his fourth album, The Great Depression. Released October 23, 2001, it was his fourth album to debut at the top of the Billboard 200, featuring
the singles "Who We Be", "We Right Here", and "Shorty Was The Bomb". Despite the album's triple Platinum certification, its commercial and critical success was lower than his previous album. His fifth
album, "Grand Champ", once again debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 charts, placing DMX as the only musical artist in history to release five consecutive albums (his entire album catalog at the
time) that debuted at number one. Singles include "Where Tha Hood At" and "Get it on the Floor". After its release, he informed the public that he planned to retire, and that Grand Champ would be his
final album.</p>

<p>DMX signed to Columbia Records in January 2006. He recorded what would be his next album, Year of the Dog...Again, while switching record labels, which caused numerous delays. It was finally released
on August 1, 2006, and lost the number one Billboard spot by only one-hundred sales. He released two more singles, "Lord Give Me A Sign" and "We In Here" On June 12, 2008, DMX released a compilation of
his greatest hits, The Definition of X: The Pick of the Litter. Def Jam released another compilation album, The Best of DMX, in 2011. which features hit singles including "Where the Hood At?" and
"X Gon' Give It to Ya". On October 11, 2011 DMX performed at the 2011 BET Hip Hop Awards. He stated that he has been working "nonstop, every day" on the new album, and plans to release it before December
of 2012. During a performance at New York's Santos Party House on December 25, 2011, DMX stated that the new album will be entitled Undisputed and would be released on March 26, 2012. This was later
confirmed by DMX (via his official Twitter account, DMX (rapper) on Twitter), where he also confirmed that its first single is scheduled for release in January 2012. A video for a new track entitled
"Last Hope" was released via Internet on September 24, 2011. DMX has not confirmed whether the track will appear on his upcoming album. Seven Arts Entertainment Inc. recently purchased David Michery's
music assets, which included some of DMX's music. DMX's had announced that Undisputed will be released on March 27, 2012. However it was later revealed that DMX did not plan to release the album on that
date, and that date was one forced upon him by the record label. The release date for the album is now set for June 26th 2012. He released a pair of EPs in 2020, Dark Man X and X Is Coming, but a
subsequent album failed to materialize. He was hospitalized in White Plains, New York on April 2, 2021 after suffering a heart attack, and remained in critical condition until April 9, when he was
pronounced dead at the age of 50.</p>
