<!-- In your browser, locate a Web site that has content for the poem or song lyrics. Copy that content. You should have at least 30 lines of content. Here in the article section below, paste the lyrics or poem content you copied from the Web. In that content, if necessary, enter Returns so that each line of the lyrics or each line of the poem is on its own line, just as you saw it displayed on the Web. In the code, make sure each line of the lyrics or the poem starts with a <br> tag and that each line is not followed by a <br> tag.
